# Three.js Import Example

This example demonstrates how to use Three.js to import and display 3D models in `.obj` format.

## Files

- `import.html`: The main HTML file that sets up the page and includes the necessary scripts.
- `import.js`: The JavaScript file that initializes the Three.js scene and handles file imports.

## How to Use

1. Open `import.html` in a web browser.
2. Use the file input at the top-left corner to select a `.obj` file from your computer.
3. The 3D model will be displayed in the viewer.

## Key Features

- Simple and clear setup for teaching purposes.
- Supports importing `.obj` files.
- Basic lighting and camera setup for visualization.

## Requirements

- A modern web browser with support for ES modules.

## Notes

- This example uses the `OBJLoader` from the Three.js library to parse `.obj` files.
- Ensure the `.obj` file is properly formatted for successful loading.
